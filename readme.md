# HTML Project Boilerplate

A simple boilerplate for my projects.

## How to use

1. on terminal/console run ```git clone https://github.com/johnnydoe82/html-project-boilerplate```
1. cd to project folder
1. run ```yarn```  or ```npm install``` --- works these days on my machine **only with yarn**!
1. run ``` gulp ```	
1. only work in ```src``` folder
